# PRE-CONTEXT

This is the graveyard of all the disorganized projects that came before the great `context` revolution.

There aren't usually model files here, and there aren't pre-print arrangement files either.

All of these files were printed on the Prusa MK3, pre multi-material upgrade.

I don't claim ownership of **any** of these files, some were generated by others and all were sliced by me. There is no guarantee any of these will work with anyone else's printer. Attempt to use them at your own risk.
